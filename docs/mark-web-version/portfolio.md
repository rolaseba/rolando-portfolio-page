- Detected hundreds of items with **zero movement since creation**
- Re-calibrated replenishment parameters (**ROP, EOQ**) based on actual behavior

### Benefits
- Physical space liberation through removal of obsolete items
- Reduction in indirect storage and maintenance expenses
- Early detection of obsolescence trends to mitigate future risk
- Improved process efficiency by aligning replenishment with actual demand

### Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## Process & Sensors Mapping Project

_Interactive hierarchical visualization tool mapping production processes and PLC tags for global digitalization initiative._

### Key Impact Metrics
- **Structured Mapping:** Hierarchy (Processes & Sensors organized)
- **Aveva PI Ready:** Integration (Standardized for digitalization)
- **Visual Tool:** Interactive (Dynamic graph with hover details)

### Overview
I developed an **interactive hierarchical visualization tool** using **Python** and Plotly to map **production processes and PLC sensors**, transforming complex plant data into a standardized, **Aveva PI-ready** structure. This established a clear digitalization foundation, reducing technical complexity and enabling **global data alignment** for corporate integration.

### Business Value
- **Standardization**: clear and hierarchical organization of processes and PLC tags.
- **Digitalization**: preparing information for integration into Aveva PI.
- **Visibility**: improved understanding of the relationship between processes and sensors.
- **Collaboration**: common ground between local and global teams for automation and Industry 4.0 projects.

### Key Results
- Development of an **interactive hierarchical graph** representing processes and parent-child relationships.
- Integration of **PLC tags and statuses** associated with each process.
- **Hover functionality** to display technical details (name, level, PLC tag, status).
- Identification of processes **“To Be Implemented (TBI)”**, highlighted with distinct visual styling.
- Exported visual representations for effective communication with stakeholders.

### Benefits
- **Reduced complexity** in managing processes and sensors.
- **Solid foundation** for signal capture and analysis in Aveva PI.
- **Scalability** for future digitalization initiatives.
- **Global alignment** in corporate data unification projects.

### Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, NetworkX, Plotly, Excel

### Methods & Techniques
- **Hierarchical Graphing:** Modeling parent-child relationships between processes using NetworkX
- **Data Integration:** Merging process definitions with PLC tag statuses from Excel sources
- **Interactive Visualization:** Creating dynamic plots with Plotly to allow exploration of the hierarchy
