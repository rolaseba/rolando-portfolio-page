## Process & Sensors Mapping Project

📌 **Description**

This project focused on developing a **mapping and visualization tool** that enabled the identification and organization of **production processes** and their **physical sensors (PLC tags)** into a clear hierarchical structure.

The tool was **key and necessary to bridge the technical complexity of the plant with the needs of the global digitalization project**, ensuring that detailed local process and sensor information could be standardized and successfully integrated into the corporate software **Aveva PI**, globally used for signal acquisition, capture, and monitoring.

The work allowed both local and global teams to gain a **unified** and **structured** view of processes and their associated signals, facilitating digitalization and integration as part of a **global information unification initiative**.

💡 **Business Value**

* **Standardization**: clear and hierarchical organization of processes and PLC tags.
* **Digitalization**: preparing information for integration into **Aveva PI**.
* **Visibility**: improved understanding of the relationship between processes and sensors.
* **Collaboration**: common ground between local and global teams for automation and Industry 4.0 projects.

📈 **Key Results – Main Findings**

* Development of an **interactive hierarchical graph** representing processes and parent-child relationships.
* Integration of **PLC tags and statuses** associated with each process.
* **Hover functionality** to display technical details (name, level, PLC tag, status).
* Identification of processes **“To Be Implemented (TBI)”**, highlighted with distinct visual styling.
* Exported visual representations for effective communication with stakeholders.
