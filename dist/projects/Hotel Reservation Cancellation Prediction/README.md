## Business Problem

### The Challenge

In a typical urban hotel generating **$10M in annual revenue**, cancellations and no-shows result in **6.7% revenue loss ($670K annually)**, with peaks of **11% during high-demand seasons**.

### Key Business Drivers

| Factor | Impact | Insight |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Distribution Channels** | 40% of losses | OTAs (e.g., Booking.com) drive highest cancellations |
| **Guest Segments** | 64-66% flexibility | Gen Z & Millennials rebook at lower prices |
| **Pricing Sensitivity** | +16% risk | Each $50 rate increase raises cancellation probability |

## Dataset

### Source & Context

**Hotel Booking Demand Dataset** - Two Portuguese hotels (July 2015 - August 2017)

He integrado los puntos de mejora que discutimos: explicamos el *porqué* de las decisiones técnicas (como el PCA dirigido y el Scaler robusto) para demostrar conocimiento del dominio, y he pulido la estructura para que se vea más profesional.

## Technical Approach

### Feature Engineering Strategy

**Targeted PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)**
Instead of applying PCA across the entire dataset, we targeted specific multicollinear subgroups to reduce noise while preserving interpretability:

  - **Guest Composition:** Combined `no_of_adults` + `no_of_children` → `no_of_people` (1 component).
  - **Stay Duration:** Combined `no_of_weekend_nights` + `no_of_week_nights` → `no_of_week_days` (1 component).
    *Impact:* Successfully reduced multicollinearity while preserving the total variance of these related features.

**Robust Scaling**
Selected `RobustScaler` over `StandardScaler` for numerical features.
*Rationale:* Hospitality data often contains extreme outliers in variables like `lead_time` and `avg_price_per_room`. RobustScaler uses statistics that are robust to outliers (scaling based on the Interquartile Range), preventing these extreme values from biasing the model.

**Feature Selection & Encoding**

  - **High-Value Features:** Retained strong predictors such as `lead_time`, `avg_price_per_room`, and `no_of_special_requests`.
  - **Noise Reduction:** Removed features with low predictive power (e.g., `arrival_date`, `required_car_parking_space`) based on feature importance analysis.
  - **Business Encoding:** Transformed seasonal variables (`arrival_month`) into risk-based categories based on historical cancellation rates.

### Preprocessing Pipeline

All preprocessing steps are encapsulated in a `ColumnTransformer` pipeline to ensure reproducibility and prevent data leakage during production inference:

```python
Pipeline Structure:
├── Numerical Features ...... RobustScaler
├── PCA Groups .............. RobustScaler + PCA (n_components=1)
└── Categorical Features .... OneHotEncoder (handle_unknown='ignore')
```

### Ensemble Architecture

We deployed a **Voting Classifier (Soft Voting)** to leverage the strengths of multiple algorithms:

```
                  ┌── Random Forest (Weight: 2.5) ──┐
Input Data ─────▶ │   CatBoost      (Weight: 1.5)   │ ──▶ Soft Voting ──▶ Final Prediction
                  └── XGBoost       (Weight: 1.0) ──┘
```

**Model Rationale:**

  - **Stability:** High weight on Random Forest (2.5) ensures robustness against noise and overfitting.
  - **Nuance:** CatBoost and XGBoost capture complex non-linear relationships and handle categorical variations effectively.
  - **Soft Voting:** Uses predicted probabilities rather than hard labels, allowing for more granular risk assessment and threshold adjustment.

## Model Performance

### Model Comparison: Under-Sampling vs. Over-Sampling (SVMSMOTE)

#### Under-Sampling Results

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Specificity |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Random Forest | 87% | 0.80 | 0.86 | 0.83 | 88% |
| XGBoost | 85% | 0.78 | 0.84 | 0.81 | 86% |
| CatBoost | 86% | 0.79 | 0.85 | 0.82 | 87% |
| **Voting Classifier** | **87.5%** | **0.81** | **0.86** | **0.83** | **87.3%** |

**Pros:** Highest recall (catches more cancellations)  
**Cons:** 12.7% false positive rate (loyalty impact)

#### Over-Sampling (SVMSMOTE) Results ✅ Selected

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Specificity |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Random Forest | 88% | 0.82 | 0.84 | 0.83 | 90% |
| XGBoost | 87% | 0.80 | 0.83 | 0.82 | 89% |
| CatBoost | 88% | 0.82 | 0.84 | 0.83 | 90% |
| **Voting Classifier** | **88.2%** | **0.83** | **0.84** | **0.83** | **89.8%** |

**Pros:** Better precision, lower FPR (10.2%), balanced metrics  
**Cons:** Slightly longer training time

### Why Over-Sampling Was Selected

1. **Better precision** → Efficient budget allocation
2. **Lower FPR** → Better customer relationships
3. **Long-term value** > short-term recall gain
