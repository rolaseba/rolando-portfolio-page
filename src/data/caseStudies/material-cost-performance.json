        "overview": "This project delivers a specialized cost analytics framework designed to identify pricing risks, detect supplier deviations, and highlight opportunities for savings in warehouse material purchases. It combines multi-year purchasing history with advanced data preparation to create custom performance indicators for cost stability and price change detection. The framework features a real-time overspend alert tool that flags excessive price increases during purchase order creation, empowering procurement teams to take immediate action.",
