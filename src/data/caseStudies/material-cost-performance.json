        "overview": "I developed a **cost analytics framework** to address **pricing risks** and **supplier deviations** within warehouse material purchases. The challenge was to transform multi-year purchasing data into actionable insights for **strategic savings**. I tackled this by engineering specialized **cost stability indicators** and implementing **real-time overspend alert** mechanisms during procurement. This solution successfully empowered the procurement team with **objective evidence** for negotiations and **automated flagging** of price increases, leading to significant identified savings and enhanced **budget control**.",
