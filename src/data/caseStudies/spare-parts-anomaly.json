        "overview": "This project detects anomalies in item consumption based on historical dispatch data from an industrial warehouse. It integrates data wrangling, time series analysis, seasonality detection, and anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual dispatch behavior for specific inventory items. The system supports proactive maintenance and stock control by highlighting abnormal consumption patterns before they escalate into critical failures.",
