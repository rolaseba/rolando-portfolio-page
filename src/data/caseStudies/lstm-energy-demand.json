        "overview": "To support national grid stability and cost-efficient energy dispatch, I developed a deep learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for hourly electricity demand forecasting. Using public data representative of Bangladesh's power grid (PGCB), the model processes 168-hour sequences to predict consumption patterns with high accuracy (3.95% MAPE), enabling proactive capacity planning and optimized resource allocation for a system managing ~25,700 MW.",
