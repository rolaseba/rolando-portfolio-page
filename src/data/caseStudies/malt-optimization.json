        "overview": "I developed a **production optimization framework** for a malt manufacturing plant by analyzing 13 years of historical operational data. The challenge was to identify which of many **process parameters** most significantly influenced **production yield** and **quality outcomes**. To address this, I applied **advanced statistical methods**—including correlation analysis and hypothesis testing—to evaluate the complex relationships between variables. This analysis successfully bridged the gap between technical process control and commercial strategy, providing actionable insights for **process improvement** and **data-driven pricing** decisions.",
