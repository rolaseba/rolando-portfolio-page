        "overview": "I led a project to tackle **inventory obsolescence** and **capital risk** by unifying data from multiple fragmented warehouse systems. The goal was to identify inactive stock and **quantify the financial exposure** from these materials. I designed a framework of **47 custom metrics** that detected obsolete items and calculated **capital at risk** from prolonged inactivity. This transformed scattered data into a strategic tool for **inventory optimization**, enabling both the recovery of immobilized value and the **prevention of future capital tie-up**.",
